<h1>The Best Movies According To Zafer Gursoy</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>Right now, you deal almost exclusively in cocaine. But the coca plant can't grow in Mexico. 
You are no more than middlemen for the Colombians. They cut you a percentage for smuggling across the border. 
But the lion's share of the profit goes to them, despite your assumption of all the risk. 
And you keep all the profits.</p>

<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>Don Eladio, please. I didn't sell anything. I apologize if you are offended by my method of obtaining this meeting.
 I merely took the initiative. I meant no insult. </p>

<h3>The Last of the Mohicans</h3>
<p>You are done. Fired. Do not show your face at the laundry again. Stay away from Pinkman. 
 Do not go near him. Ever. Are you listening to me? What do you say? For now, but he'll come around. 
 In the meantime there's the matter of your brother-in-law. He is a problem you promised to resolve.
 You have failed. Now is left to me. To deal with him. If you try to interfere, this becomes a much simpler matter.
 I will kill your wife, I will kill your son, I will kill your infant daughter.</p>
